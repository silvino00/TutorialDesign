# **The T word that everybody skips**
### **Introduction**
As we all now, the first impresion that a player has with a game is very important, because it can determine whether the player gets engaged with the game and continue playing or leaves the game due to the lack of persuasion and fun of those first minutes.
Tutorials are most of the times the first thing that comes into contact with the player, so they must provide, apart from the main goal of a tutorial, the suficient persuasion, fun and entertainment to maintain the player engaged with the game.

#### **General Problems**
Before explaining which is the main goal of a tutorial and what it consists of, I think it is important to explain a general problems that happens sometimes.
As they must be a very short fragment of the game and have to concentrate a lot of information, they sometimes happen to bore the players or even make him feel overwhelmed with so much information. Apart from that, even if the game is awesome, if the tutorial is not good it can affect the whole player experience.

### **Tutorial Main Objective**
The main objective of a tutorial is to introduce the player all the information that he will need in orther to have a great experience during the game. Within all this information we include the context were the player is going to be inmersed, the mechanics and obviously the controls of the game. 

First of all, the context is necessary to show the player the world where he is going to play, something about the story plot, how is the character or even a basci explanation of the world rules.

Secondly, show mechanics to the player is fundamental to show what is he going to do, which are the rules of the game but also let him discover some mechanics by his own.

Finally, and for me the most important one, is to teach the player how to interact with the game. Although tutorial design has nothing to do with the correct choice of the controls, I want to make a mention on how important is to make the choice as intuitive and easy as possible to provide a perfect interaction between the player and the gameplay. 

Apart from all that, it is important to take into account that a tutorial does not necessarilly have to be anchored at the start of the game, because as I said before, the aim is to teach the player all the information needed to have a great experience, which thing can be explained at any point ofthe game.

### **Tutorial Formats**
Let's take a look at different ways of tackling this, from worst to best, and see what we can learn from them.

#### --> **No tutorial**
This is the worst kind of tutorial. Due to some years ago phisycal distribution was the only way of distribution, companies took advantage of it introducing a paper manual where all the controls, mechanics and information of the game were explained. By using this strategy they didn't have to introduce a tutorial in the game itself, players oly had to read the instruction manual.

Nowadays, due to digital distribution is becoming more and more comon this strategy can not be done, so lots of companies decide not to introduce a tutorial and let the players discover how the game works by themselves. In some cases this can work, but in many others players can´t understand some specific aspects of the game, which can affect their experience playing it.

A good example is the way stats are handled in Darksiders 2, because like any game with a loot system, has lots of statistics that define the player character. Some are staples of the genre and pretty easy to understand (health, strength, defence), but there is one particular stat (Arcane) that has no obvious meaning and there is no way for the player to know for sure without looking outside the game for information.

#### --> **Tutorial by exposition**
We can define this type of tutorial as the easiest one to implement and one of the least effective. The tutorial by exposition is any tutorial which consists of telling or showing the player how something is done outside of actual gameplay. This includes, but is not limited to, the likes of text explanations prefacing gameplay and the traditional “controls” screen.
As I said earlier, this type of tutorial is not very effective, and can even cause more confusion than it does clarity. This can be produced by two diferent reeasons:
- The first one is because normally when people see this "controls" screens don't want to read it and tend to pass it away.
- The second one is because even if you spend some time reading it, once the gameplay starts people typically don't remember what they have just read.

This leads us to the biggest issue with this tutorial type: context. Mechanics and controls for games can often be quite numerous and complicated, but the player is typically eased into them through the context of relevant gameplay scenarios. Attempting to present the player with most or all of the information up front will simply lead to them not understanding or not remembering most of it.
The two ways games with this tutorial type typically tackle this issue is to either present particular information only when it is relevant, or to allow their tutorial to be constantly revisited by a menu. Both of these approaches are annoying and hurt pacing by constantly stopping gameplay.

A good example of this is just about any Devil May Cry game which, like any other beat-‘em-up, has a move list. Constantly needing to pause the game to look at this menu and remember the commands required for certain moves is really annoying. Unfortunately, this type of thing can be difficult to avoid, as walking the player through the use of every possible move would be extremely tedious.

#### --> **Tutorial room**
The tutorial room is a section of gameplay that walks the player through the actions they need to know in order to play. This almost always takes place in a separate area or level not seen in any actual gameplay, and is quite frequently optional.

When thinking about tutorials, what comes to mind at firstis tutorial's romm type, because it was the most used one during the last console generation, and is also one of the only types of tutorial which is often called a tutorial in-game.

A perfect example would be the tutorial for Jamestown: Legend of the Lost Colony, an indie scrolling shooter made by Final Form Games.
This specific tutorial perfectly depicts the essence of the tutorial room and why it can be an effective way of showing a player how your game works. The tutorial is short and everything you are told is clearly demonstrated.

Althoug this seems the perfect way to do a tutorial, is far from it. It can be a very good way to show players how a game works in simple games with easy and simple mechanics, but in certain types of games with more complex mechanics it may not be as effective.

#### --> **The contextual lesson**
The contextual lesson type is basically a system where the one tutorial room is chopped into little pieces and added organically throughout the gameplay of a title.

The biggest drawback of this type of tutorials is that the game will simply wait for you to press an specific button and won't let you progress until you have done it. The problem is that this can become a little bit monotonous and boring and although in the case of Uncharted 3 is very short and the player doesn't usually end up bored in others games maybe it is not like that.

A very good example of this type of tutorial is Uncharted 3. in this game, the gameplay is briefly paused and instructions on what buttons perform the action immediately required pop up on screen. This part of the tutorial is incredibly short, because it only presents what you need to know at the specific moment by sending pop ups, and this part of the gameplay has literally no impact in the rest of the game, it is only done for the tutorial.

There is a subtype of the contextual lesson type called "The thematically relevant contextual lesson". The difference between both of them is that this subtype is generally presented in a thematically relevant way during gameplay, rather that the usual one used.

This includes things like arrow keys being carved on the back of a cave wall at the beginning of a platformer, or the spacebar and a little jumping guy being drawn on the wall before a platformer's first ledge, or even squad mates telling you how to take cover when you enter your first firefight. This kind of tutorial is awesome because it's incredibly easy to implement and feels really slick, with instructions blending seamlessly with the gameplay experience.

#### --> **No tutorial**
At the begining we started with a tutorial type called "No tutorial", and now we are anding with another one called "No tutorial". It may seem like this doesn't make no sense at all, but it actually has a lot of sense. Just as the first tutorial type is the worst one, having no tutorial at all is also the best, and this has everything to do with the inherent nature of video games.

A tutorial fundamentally shows an explanation of all the rules of the game, showing the player all the information needed to understand it and overcoming obstacles. Just like in any other type of game, the fun in video games comes from actually playing them, rather than learning how each game works.

However, due to their guided nature, video games present an opportunity unseen in most other forms of games: the ability to include the teaching aspect as part of the game itself. That's where not having a tutorial comes in.

Two examples of games that perfectly reflect this type of tutorials and that are more than known in our society are the Super Mario Bross saga and Pacman. None of them have a tutorial but both of them show the players how to play the videogame. In the image below we can see how Super Mario Bross show the players that they can duble jump. What they do is to add a series of coins in such a way that it shows the player that there is an option to take them all. At that moment, the player realizes that there must be a double jump that allows him to perform that specific action.

### **How to make your tutorial amazing**
In this section I am going to show you some tips to make your tutorial better and make the players not want to pass it.
#### --> **People don't want to be teached**
Something very important to keep in mind is that when someone run a game only want play. Most of the people come from work, shcool or just a long day of working, so what they want is forget everything and stop paying attention to anything else.

#### --> **Keep the flow going**

#### --> **Not everyone learns in the same way**

#### --> **Balance the experience**

#### --> **Use mechanics to teach mechanics**
