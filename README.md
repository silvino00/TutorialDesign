# **The T word that everybody skips**
### **Introduction**
As we all now, the first impresion that a player has with a game is very important, because it can determine whether the player gets engaged with the game and continue playing or leaves the game due to the lack of persuasion and fun of those first minutes.
Tutorials are most of the times the first thing that comes into contact with the player, so they must provide, apart from the main goal of a tutorial, the suficient persuasion, fun and entertainment to maintain the player engaged with the game.

#### **General Problems**
Before explaining which is the main goal of a tutorial and what it consists of, I think it is important to explain a general problems that happens sometimes.
As they must be a very short fragment of the game and have to concentrate a lot of information, they sometimes happen to bore the players or even make him feel overwhelmed with so much information. Apart from that, even if the game is awesome, if the tutorial is not good it can affect the whole player experience.

### **Tutorial Main Objective**
The main objective of a tutorial is to introduce the player all the information that he will need in orther to have a great experience during the game. Within all this information we include the context were the player is going to be inmersed, the mechanics and obviously the controls of the game. 

First of all, the context is necessary to show the player the world where he is going to play, something about the story plot, how is the character or even a basci explanation of the world rules.

Secondly, show mechanics to the player is fundamental to show what is he going to do, which are the rules of the game but also let him discover some mechanics by his own.

Finally, and for me the most important one, is to teach the player how to interact with the game. Although tutorial design has nothing to do with the correct choice of the controls, I want to make a mention on how important is to make the choice as intuitive and easy as possible to provide a perfect interaction between the player and the gameplay. 

Apart from all that, it is important to take into account that a tutorial does not necessarilly have to be anchored at the start of the game, because as I said before, the aim is to teach the player all the information needed to have a great experience, which thing can be explained at any point ofthe game.

### **Tutorial Formats**
Let's take a look at different ways of tackling this, from worst to best, and see what we can learn from them.
